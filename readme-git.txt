Target - just ignore compiled files
zork.iml - we want to ignore the IntelliJ file, because we don’t need in git
DS_Store - Part of OS X, not interesting for git push
.idea   - we don’t need the itellij stuff

All of the above is just extra fluff, we just want the source code and pom.xml so we can use maven.
