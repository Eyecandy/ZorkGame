General: The idea for making the game fun and a bit challenging, is that you have to find certain tools to open certain objects so you can progress. And in order to defeat monsters you need to obtain weapons, with high damage to win the fights. The better the weapon the faster you can defeat the monster. Even though the damage is random the likelihood of high damage increases with a good weapon.
