You are standing in front of heavy metal door which is locked. Looking the other way it seems like you are standing in a cylindrical tower, it is completly dark except for torches that lights up the stairs which leads upwards in a spiral further than the eye can see. 
there seems to be only out of this place, which is up. Walking up there a point where you see two doors one is directly next to the wall another one is across a half rotten wooden bridge. If you can find your way in the across the bridge then there will be will a treasure or two there and some useful items, the same goes for the room which is next to you, now you probably want to continue upstairs after you've found some helpful tools. higher up you will encouter a big gap in the staircases,and you will hear a soothing sound echoing down the tower. If you can somehow get accross the gap, you will then find yourself walking closer and closer to the enchanting sound. At one point you will find yourself next to an open door, in the shadows of the green glowing braizer you can see movement.And there is a smell of gasoline, you step inside and the floor is all wet. You can't see much unless you fire up the torch, but will you be detected?
